# Automatic encoding of manuscripts catalogues with GROBID

Originally designed for dictionaries, we are trying to use GROBID with manuscripts catalogues.

## Credits

GROBID dictionaries is developped by Mohamed Khemakhem ([GitHub](https://github.com/MedKhem)).

More info on GROBID technoligies can be found [here](https://grobid.readthedocs.io).

Research on catalogues and training is carried by Simon Gabay.

## Corpus

Tests are carried on scans of the *Revue des autographes*, directes by Gabriel Charavay ([data.bnf](http://data.bnf.fr/10429866/gabriel_charavay/))

## Methodology

PDF are OCRised with [Transkribus](https://transkribus.eu). You can ask for our model.

The GROBID model is trained on four excerpts (three pages each) of the corpus (`toyData/dataset/dictionary-segmentation/corpus>PDF`).

## Files
Training data are available in `ToyData`

Samples of pdf and tools to manipulate them (`cpdf`) are in `TrainingTools`

## Paper

A first paper was presented at the TEI 2018 in Tokyo
